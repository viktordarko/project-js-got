## **The Game**

You are Jon Snow and the goal is to not be eaten (touched) by the dragons that fall from the top of the screen, if you're touched 3 times game is over.

## **Minor changes**

1. Game ends if the player doesnt have lifes left, the remaining dragons are cleared from the board, the player "dies" and turns into a skull that keeps spinning, a banner of game over appears and floats and a restart button appears

2. Changed size of the game board to fit more dragons (enemies).

3. There is a start button, the score in the beginning is 0 and the lives are 3 (more ahead).

4. Start/Restart button

## **Major changes**

1. Score update, every 5 seconds the multiplayer increases to 3 times the original value.

2. The difficulty increases every 5 seconds, an extra dragon is allowed on the gameboard to a maximum of 8 at a time (full-board)

3. Lives system, 3 lives and every time the player is touched it decreases by 1.

4. Music when the start games with the show theme and when it ends with the rains of castamere.
